### City Palace Museum

The City Palace Museum is the jewel in the crown of the Udaipur City Palace Complex. It is here that you can immerse yourself in the history of the Maharanas of Mewar, and really get a feel for their culture and how royalty lived. The sprawling museum is actually a series of palaces, including the **Mardana Mahal** (palace for the royal men) and **Zenana Mahal** (palace for the royal women).
